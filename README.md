<p align="center"> BYI : I'm mentally ill and I'm not the best person to come to for advice. I also don't do well with people venting to me, but if you're my friend and need to let it out, feel free. I just can't guarentee that I'll be the best help, but I'll always be there to listen.

<p align="center">I'm not a very social person unless we are close, as I'm distrustful of new people due to past reasons. I may also tend to distance myself when I am upset or not well, so please don't feel offended, it likely isn't your fault.
<p align="center"> C+H is always encouraged unless said otherwise. W2I always or I will likely not see your message, as I get distracted easily and will likely be switching tabs.
<p align="center"> I'm a Loki IRL, doubles do not interact unless we are already friends. I get uncomfortable around doubles or just when people say "I'm literally Loki" or they try to imitate him in a way. It irks me out and just seems really corny.
